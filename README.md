# RockPaperScissors
Javascript assignment for The Odin Project.

Currently working on v3 which is primarily improving the visual design / UX / UI.

Update 1 - v2 completed 25/04/2020

Game updated to have a front end and manuipulate the DOM intead of being played in the console. Slightly refactored code to accomplish this but
most of the code held up. While the front end is currently very unappealing the underlying output is solid and shouldn't need a ton of new features to the javascript in order to improve the UI / UX.

GetWinner() should probably be reworked as a switch statement.
const variables should probably all be capitalised.
reasonably DRY but could be improved in some areas, such as event listeners for buttons

/////////////////////

v1 completed 20/04/2020. Code is ok but not perfect. getWinner function is particularly ugly and
could use the most love in a future update (too long, too many if statements, too much repetition.)

Will revist and look to improve when adding the front end.
