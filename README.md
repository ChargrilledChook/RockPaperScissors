# RockPaperScissors
Javascript assignment for The Odin Project.

v1 completed 20/04/2020. Code is ok but not perfect. getWinner function is particularly ugly and
could use the most love in a future update (too long, too many if statements, too much repetition.)

Will revist and look to improve when adding the front end.
